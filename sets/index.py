Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

discard()	 	Remove the specified item

intersection()	&	Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets

intersection_update()	&=	Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)

isdisjoint()	 	Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not

issubset()	<=	Returns whether another set contains this set or not
 	<	Returns whether all items in this set is present in other, specified set(s)
